If you want to see the apartment, message me privately.
You'll need to pay the first and last month's rent. Of course, you need to be employed and provide at least two paystubs, a letter from your employer, and a credit score report.",11 visits,https://www.kijiji.ca/v-apartments-condos/city-of-toronto/2-bedroom-2-bathroom/1688107215

includes utilities, internet, in house laundry, cute n v friendly cat!
St Clair and Dufferin. Great transit options
access to front yard and small garden
lots of little restaurants and coffee shops
small gym 2 minute walk across the street
Starts with a 4 month sublease, open to extending if things are feeling good
Small, East-facing room with a big bay window and a decent closet.
Quiet room, in spite of being very close to a busy intersection.
Best suited for mature student or working professional, or someone working in and out of town. This place is a great landing pad for someone busy with very few belongings, tbh! On the plus side, you don't need to bring much! Room comes unfurnished, but in a pinch I can wrangle a bed and a desk-- that's really all there is room for! Please specify in your response which you prefer.
Our kitchen is fully supplied and doesn't have room for anything new, beyond some basic pantry space. Same goes for the rest of the common spaces, fair warning!
About us-- we're two women-- late 30s and early 50s-- who are very friendly but also somewhat keep to ourselves and fairly busy. Both very crafty and hands on people. We keep very tidy and respectful of each others space, but we also like to be accommodating and considerate, and keep each other posted re our general schedules and whereabouts so that we can expand a little more when the other is out. In part this is because the common spaces are small, so we do our best to co-ordinate!

I have a two room up for grabs in a pretty sweet 3-bed unit at the Selby, starting June 1, 2024, for a 12-month lease. This place is a spacious 1400 sqft with massive 12-foot ceilings!
The kitchen's got all the bells and whistles, plus an island, plates, and cooking utensils ready to be shared. Our living room is all decked out with comfy furniture, plants, and cool art that really make it feel like home. And for movie nights, we've got a 65-inch TV with a killer surround sound system.
Location? We're at 25 Selby Street in Bloor-Sherbourne. You can practically roll out of bed and into the subway station, grocery stores, pharmacies, and restaurants. We're just a quick stroll from Bloor and Yonge, Rosedale, Yorkville, Evergreen Brick Works, and Riverdale Park (for all you nature buffs). If you're at UofT or TU, it's a breezy walk.
The Selby's got all the cool stuff: gym, pool deck, spa (steam, sauna, meditation room), BBQ area, movie theatre, dining rooms, game rooms - you name it. Plus, there's always something going on, from building events to free weekly fitness classes (HIIT, Yoga), and even Salsa classes.
Master Bedroom - 1750 CAD/month This room is huge with an ensuite bathroom and walk-in closet. It's pretty much like having your own little apartment.
Second Bedroom - 1350 CAD/month

Location
This two-story apartment is located on a quiet tree-lined street in the heart of three well-established West Toronto neighbourhoods: Roncesvalles, High Park, and Bloor West Village. This area is well known for its great food scene and family friendly communities. Recently, our neighbourhood High Park/Swansea has been ranked in the Top 3, out of 140, in Toronto Life Magazine's ""The Best Places to live in the City.""
The apartment is within walking distance of excellent primary and secondary schools, local gyms, yoga studios, bistros, cafes, restaurants, pubs, bakeries, fruit stores, specialty cheese stores, butcher shops and the recently saved and community run Revue Cinema.
Old growth trees and many parks surround Alhambra Ave. Notably, the house is two blocks from High Park, Toronto's largest park and hub for outdoor activities, including numerous playgrounds, ponds, running/hiking/walking trails, a children's zoo, skating rink, swimming pool, children's wading pools, lease free dog areas, baseball/soccer/football fields, restaurants, and the Howard Park Tennis Club. Just a short walk south from High Park leads you to the Lakeshore where you can traverse the waterfront Martin Goodman running and biking trail, Sunnyside Beach and its volleyball courts, restaurant, and swimming pool. Other nearby parks include High Park, Columbus Parkette, Erwin Krichhahn Park and Lithuania Park.
Transportation
Subway and Streetcars: Our Neighbourhood scores 100 out of 100 on the Transit score website for cities. Just steps to the Keele or Dundas West Subway stations and to 4 different streetcars lines that run through the city. (505 Dundas line, 306 Carlton/College line, and 504 King St Line, Queen Line)
Walking: Based on the ""WALK SCORE WEBSITE"" our property on Alhambra Ave, has a Walk Score of 98 out of 100. This location is a Walker's Paradise so daily errands do not require a car.

DOWNTOWN TORONTO ALL INCLUSIVE STUDENT SUMMER SUBLET,1490,"111 Carlton Street, Toronto, ON",2024-02-26 04:37:22,,,,,,,,,No,,Yes,,,,,,"HI! I'm a first year OCAD student and I'm leaving for the summer. I'm looking for a female student to sublet my apartment at Parkside Student Residence. Available from April 19 – August 19, 2023. Can be available a week or so earlier.
The unit is a 2-bedroom, 1 bath - with a common living room and bathroom, and two private bedrooms with desk. The other room will be occupied by my friend, a very kind female student first year at TMU. The unit is fully furnished with a single bed, desk, and office chair in the bedroom and a couch with small tables and smart TV in the common area.
Rent includes all utilities, Wi-Fi, 24-hour security and maintenance. Amenities include access to 24-hour gym, theatre room, games rooms, study rooms, outdoor terrace, etc(see last picture for more). Mail service and card-operated laundry facilities are located within the building.
Are you tired of making meals every night when you're tired from a long day at school? Well, There is an additional mandatory meal plan for the cafeteria located in the building, which includes 3 quality meals per day at an unlimited buffet. The cost is $1490 per month for rent, plus the unlimited monthly meal plan $910 ($2400 total). Price can be lightly negotiated. It gives parents great peace of mind, to have their student in a safe building with all meals included.
Parkside Student Residence is located across from the historic Maple Leaf Gardens and is within walking distance of many schools including the University of Toronto, Toronto Metropolitan University, George Brown College, and OCADu. The TTC streetcar stops right out front and the closest subway stop is College Station. Parkside is also within walking distance to shopping at IKEA and Eaton Centre.

With a view of the city and easy access to everything in the annex area. What is included is heat water hydro/electricity. What you May pay for/set up is internet (it is wired and ready to go, but you will be solely responsible for that). There is no dishwasher. There is coin laundry in the building. There is an elevator. No parking. It is a 6 minute walk to the Bloor spadina subway and metro gerocery store. There are so many great places to eat, librarys, museums, arts, theatre - shopping and entertainment in the area. You are very close to yorkville too.
The location is fantastic! The apartment is fairly spacious for 1 bathroom including tub, 1 bedroom with a very comfortable queen size bed, two side tables and closet. The kitchen is half open concept with two stools for the island, a dining table off to the side, and living room. There is also a balcony, with a table and 2 chairs. There is a tv, but again, no cable and that would be part of the internet if you choose to hook it up and pay for a plan that works for you.
All in all, it is a great place to live in the city. Though do note it is an older building, so it does have that charm. They do keep it up with taking care of it. And you will be going through the building manager with her required paperwork and such to check that everything is in order for accountability & ID to know who is in the unit incase of an emergency. Though all payments will be going through myself and my mother, on which who’s behalf I am posting this add for the 1 time only - temporary 3 month sublet.
A $500 certified check is required for damages which will be returned to you upon seeing everything is as it was left. Along with the 1sts month payment immediately ($3,300) to hold it and the remainder ($6,600)the day before you will be moving in. Which we will have to arrange to get the elevator if you require it to be held for you.
The place is furnished so once we are further along in the process I can give you a more detailed list of items you will have access to. For example there is a microwave and basic kitchen ware. Serious inquiries only. No refunds. So the total amount is a certified cheque to be returned to you upon no damages/things left as they were found for $500, plus 3 months furnished rent ($3,300 x 3 = $9, 900).
March 15 is a possible start date - June 15 2024. No smoking, pets or children. Ideal for 1 person or a couple. I will be happy to answer questions for serious inquiries only.

1 Large room in 2 br apartment,1500,"Toronto, ON M4M 1Y2",,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,"Rental post 800sq/ft corner apartment
OFFERING SHORT/LONG TERM RENTAL
Type: 1 big room in a 2 bedroom apartment
Level: 2nd floor above a store
Date available: March1st
Term: 6mos/1year
Rent: $1500 + internet($25) + utilities ($60 right now) this is split in two
Location: Gerrard and Broadview
Streetcar on doorstep 505 & 506. 20min walk to Broadview station or 8min streetcar/bus. The apartment is located in the intersection so very accessible to all directions. The apartment building is also beside an Asian fruit market/grocery store called Galaxy and so many eatery’s restaurants you name it. It’s a pretty prime location. And one of the prettiest parks in Toronto Riverdale park. It takes 25-30min by bus to go downtown.
Accessibility: There is a big flight of stairs up to the apartment with a handrail. There's a big window in your bedroom, and all over the apartment (as shown in the photos) I like to burn incenses, candles, and make this home a really cozy place where you can recharge and also have fun.
About me: I’m a 32 year old, queer nonbinary, GNC folk from the Philippines. I’ve been calling Toronto home for 7years now. I am in the arts scene, I make music and I Dj and I work part time serving/barista. That being said, there will be music playing in the house(being fully transparent) but I am very cooperative and mindful of my space. I’d love if all can share the living room space to be creative and also relax. I like to keep the space tidy and clean and smells good. And I am very easy to talk to and very approachable. I’m trying to eat vegan but I don’t mind if you eat meat :) I’d love to have healthy communication in the space as well. Also I don’t smoke but I’m very 420 friendly
Our living space: With my lifestyle, I’m truly rarely home but when I am home I like to relax and enjoy my space, I probably would just stay in my room sometimes but I’d also love to use the living room to unwind. Previous tenants used the living room as their office so I was not able to appreciate the space and use it as they work from home. I don’t usually have people over but when I do it’d be one or two and we would love to socialize if you’re down to it if not that’s cool too. We are all professionals with work so we're never up very late. For the most part I enjoy a quiet living environment and making it somewhere I can be productive (with my music) and recharge.
Pets: landlord is open to pets as long as pet is not loud and don’t mess up the apartment. Although I am allergic to cats. I just need the dog to be cleaned after to. Is all <3
What we’re looking for: We’re looking for someone with similar expectations and responsibilities, someone who is in the industry of the arts as well, if not then someone who is open to it. Who is friendly and clean and thoughtful of our shared living space.
Who can help me turn the living room into a cute little haven for creating and relaxing
BIPOC folks to the front <3
PS :
-Couples are welcome so we can split the rent in 3! The room is big enough <3
-I can teach you Tagalog
-FREE PALESTINE
-ACAB
-ANTI-CAPITALIST
-✊✊✊✊
-photos of the living room is from previous previous tenants before me and current roommates(that’s moving out) and I wish to make it look like this again. Very open to suggestions <3

ABOUT ME: 40-year-old extrovert European professional male immigrant, with keen interest in sciences, healthcare, aviation, 80s music, travelling, ..., currently doing his PhD and working in academia and healthcare. My current roommate is moving out, so I'm looking for someone to come and join the awesome space I have! I would like to find a flatmate with whom I would get along, share dinners occasionally, chat, feel like at home. I am clean and organized, and I would like to keep apartment like that all the time. While my future flatmate will not be able to have big parties as all the neighbours are quiet, they may be able to host occasionally and have friends over. You will have to be pet friendly (I have a dog staying here often with me). I absolutely love this apartment, it has the most stunning view, facing midtown (so no direct Sun until late afternoons in summer which helps with heat), and I would like to share this special place with someone similar to me in interests and ability to keep the place as it is now – warm, cozy, clean and safe. During the week I'm either working (3 days away) or at home. In summer I am off completely from work, so I spent many days at home or I travel. On the weekends I host sometimes or go out with friends. I often use the common space for cooking, TV watching, hosting friends for drinks or a dinner party.
If interested, please DM me and we can chat and take it from there? Thanks",100 visits,https://www.kijiji.ca/v-room-rental-roommate/city-of-toronto/bedroom-available-in-a-shared-2-bedroom-apartment/1684059968
